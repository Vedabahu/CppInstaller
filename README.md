# C and C++ Compiler Installer

This is a script using which you can easily install C and C++ basic nececities in *windows* only.

This script downloads and installs the files from [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/) and adds it to the path.
This is done automatically and not much human intervention is required.

This is still a new script and is not yet meature enough. I will develope it furthur and make is more user friendly as time passes.

## Usage

You have 2 options. You can choose `gcc with clang` or `only gcc`. If you don't know what you are doing, choose `only gcc`.
